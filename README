NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OurPkgVersion - no line insertion and does Package
    version with our

VERSION
    version 0.1.6

SYNOPSIS
    in dist.ini

            [OurPkgVersion]

    in your modules

            # VERSION

DESCRIPTION
    This module was created as an alternative to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion and uses some code from that module.
    This module is designed to use a the more readable format "our $VERSION
    = $version;" as well as not change then number of lines of code in your
    files, which will keep your repository more in sync with your CPAN
    release. It also allows you slightly more freedom in how you specify
    your version.

  EXAMPLES
    in dist.ini

            ...
            version = 0.01;
            [OurPkgVersion]

    in lib/My/Module.pm

            package My::Module;
            # VERSION
            ...

    output lib/My/Module.pm

            package My::Module;
            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            ...

    please note that whitespace before the comment is significant so

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
                    # VERSION
            }
            ...

    becomes

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
                    our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            }
            ...

    while

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
            # VERSION
            }
            ...

    becomes

            package My::Module;
            BEGIN {
            our $VERSION = '0.01'; # VERSION
            }
            ...

    Also note, the package line is not in any way significant, it will
    insert the "our $VERSION" line anywhere in the file before "# VERSION"
    as many times as you've written "# VERSION" regardless of whether or not
    inserting it there is a good idea. OurPkgVersion will not insert a
    version unless you have "# VERSION" so it is a bit more work.
